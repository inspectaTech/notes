# Ssl certificate research

[letsenrypt - parent site of free ssl certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/)   
[certbot - part of letsenrypt, i used this with digital ocean on the command line](https://certbot.eff.org/)   


**there's supposed to be a way to do ssl for free through this site**   
[ssl for free site](https://www.sslforfree.com/)   
[ssl for free hint ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvgrVANjuo)   

>i tried it on earthlink with no success, but i would like to keep trying.  they gave me 3 files and i don't know what to do with 2 of them.  the certificate turns out to be useless with an error that the certificate the the public key don't match up


##### create a way to degrade site back to http (just in case)
