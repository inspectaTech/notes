gC=q

R
Thank you very much for validating. 

D
im back from chatting with ehost about my nameserver they say its not theirs

R
Could you please provide me the nameserver information which you want to change?

D
the wrote: 'I see that your both domains getalight.org and sunzao.us are transferred to Justhost.com , so you will need to contact them to change domain name servers'

then they wrote:

'Daniel, right now domain DNS are pointing to us , but the domain registration is not with us , we can update the DNS only if we have domain registration with us
'

R
Should I set the nameserver which will point to clodflare?

D
ns141.ehosts.com & ns142.ehosts.com

R
As I see your nameserver is currently set on https://my.justhost.com/cgi/dm

D
it certainly is. ns1.justhost.com

even though public records show something else. i guess thats why the confusion.

R
Correct if you need to change your nameserver it will be done by your registrar https://www.whois.com/whois/getalight.org which is PDR Ltd. d/b/a PublicDomainRegistry.com

D
https://www.whatsmydns.net/#NS/getalight.org

R
I suggest you to once update namserver from registrar also there might be they didn't update from there end

D
