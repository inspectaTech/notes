# digitalocean setup

### setup a digitalocean account
- it helps to have an email you have access to.
- a droplet password will be sent to that email once the new droplet is created


### [droplet how tos](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/)

choose an image
at first i had ubuntu 18.04 highlighted
then i went to 1 click apps and chose to do a lamp on 18.04
[digitalocean LAMP tutorials](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/lamp/)

then i destroyed that one and created a phpmyadmin droplet
[digitalocean phpmyadmin tutorials](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/mysql/)
[phpmyadmin docs](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/index.html)

chose a size
standard $5 plan

select additional options
IPv6 and monitor

### [login as root](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-console/)
[How to Connect to your Droplet with OpenSSH on Linux or macOS](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/openssh/)
>Once you have your Dropletâ€™s IP address, username, and password (if necessary), follow the instructions for your SSH client. OpenSSH is included on Linux and macOS. Windows users with Bash also have access to OpenSSH. Windows users without Bash can use PuTTY.

```
ssh root@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
```
**to login as root initially you have to copy and paste the password from the email your receive from creating the droplet**
note: you will have to paste the password blind using right click paste then type enter

once you login in using the pasted password you will be asked to change the password starting with pasting the same initial password blindly and typing enter.

then you can blindly type and retype to confirm your desired root password.

### changing your custom root password

### [creating a non root user](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04)

1. login as root
2. add a new user
**'demo' represents name of new user**
```
$ adduser demo
```

3. give user root privileges
```
$ gpasswd -a demo sudo
```

4. add public key authentication
- generate key with keygen (already done for root)
- copy the public key to the user
```
$ ssh-copy-id demo@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
```

### Configure SSH Daemon (to disallow remote ssh root access)
open the following filie
```
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

change this line to no
```
PermitRootLogin yes
```

save and exit using ctrl-x, y (for yes) and enter to confirm the default file name

### Reload SSH
```
$ service ssh restart
```

**thats it**

### [path to www/html folder](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/what-is-the-correct-folder-to-put-my-website-files-var-www-or-var-www-html)
```
cd ../var/www/html
$ ls
```
**back out of ~ root folder then > var > www > html**
ls exposes the index.html file in the root html folder



### create a new root password
a root password is sent to your email account but says you will be asked to change it the first time you log into the server. so have a strong password ready when you log in.

### [how to add ssh keys to droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/)
[is it safe to use same ssh key on multiple servers?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27661/good-practice-to-use-same-ssh-keypair-on-multiple-machines)
**seems like its ok**

### create ssh key
**i navigated into the target dir**
```
$   ssh-keygen.exe
```
output
**still asked to specify rout or use default**
```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/d3pot/.ssh/id_rsa): /c/Users/d3pot/.ssh/kratos/id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/d3pot/.ssh/kratos/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/d3pot/.ssh/kratos/id_rsa.pub.

```
**even though i saved the key in kratos dir and navigated into it ssh-copy-id didn't use it. it used the old one that was naturally in ~/.ssh folder**

### upload public key
[GOTCHA: ssh-copy-id no identities found error ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22530886/ssh-copy-id-no-identities-found-error)
have to be on localhost to use not on the server
```
$ ssh-copy-id root@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
```

output
```
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/c/Users/d3pot/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

```

### [add domain names](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/dns/how-to/add-domains/)
[How To Point to DigitalOcean Nameservers From Common Domain Registrars](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-point-to-digitalocean-nameservers-from-common-domain-registrars)
**find your hosting providers and follow the illustrations**
>It will take some time for the name server changes to propagate after you've saved them. During this time, the domain registrar communicates the changes you've made with your ISP (Internet Service Provider). In turn, your ISP caches the new nameservers to ensure quick site connections. This process usually takes about 30 minutes, but could take up to a few hours depending on your registrar and your ISP's communication methods.
