#### Bower   
Bower is going to be the main challenge since bower is mostly deprecated

[bower home](https://bower.io/)   
[How to migrate away from Bower?](https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower/)   
[bower-away on GitHub](https://github.com/sheerun/bower-away)   

usage

```
  yarn global add bower-away # or "npm install -g bower-away"
  bower-away # listen and repeat!
```
> it looks lik i can use npm instead of yarn - thats great.

#### [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)   
> hopefully not needed


> im not sure i can even test the media server locally.  this may be something i can only do on a live server machine running linux - the install instructions for installing the media server only covers linux installs

#### Yarn
idk if i need yarn since yarn and npm do the same thing.  i think bower-away changes the bower format to work
with yarn
