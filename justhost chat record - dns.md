I see that your both domains getalight.org and example.com are transferred to Justhost.com , so you will need to contact them to change domain name servers
8:12:56 PM
Daniel
i told them that. they told me i needed to contact you. the global dns site whatsmydns.net/#NS/getalight.org has ns141.ehosts.com as its target
8:13:50 PM

Daniel, right now domain DNS are pointing to us , but the domain registration is not with us , we can update the DNS only if we have domain registration with us


ok. i figured as much. thank you. ill check back with them.
