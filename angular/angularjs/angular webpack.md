# Bundle angular with webpack

**i need to do this in another location other than the live/test site - i want to create a copy on localhost**

### preceived challenges

creating a clone
- module id's won't match up which may make other parts that depend on the module id's to lose track of them.
- if clone site has less modules and id's start in lower index i may be able to skip this issue but that isn't very likely
- i may also be able to re-index the modules in place then move them?
- also how can we move only the modules for the psmod - i believe we can target them specifically in the query
ex: where component = PSMOD

**research making a full site backup**
