### [deleting files](https://discoposse.com/2016/11/08/git-remove-multiple-deleted-files/)

##### the issue
```
d3pot (master *) notes $ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        deleted:    New Text Document.txt
        deleted:    boilerplate css media queries.md
        deleted:    boilerplate_cdn_protection.md
        deleted:    boilerplate_google_icons.md
        deleted:    boilerplate_js_hold_fn.md
        deleted:    boilerplate_view_html_php.md
        deleted:    bookmark constructor.md
        deleted:    bp_BTK_tags.md
        deleted:    bp_angular_controller_sample.md

##### GOTCHA: [Why does git status show branch is up-to-date when changes exist upstream?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27828404/why-does-git-status-show-branch-is-up-to-date-when-changes-exist-upstream)   
>What the status is telling you is that you're behind the ref called origin/master which is a local ref in your local repo.

>Until you do the fetch step (either on its own or via git pull) your local repo has no way to know that there are additional commits upstream, and git status only looks at your local origin/master ref.

```
>The result should be your master is now essentially seotweaks.
(-s ours is short for --strategy=ours)

>This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively ignoring all changes from all other branches. It is meant to be used to supersede old development history of side branches. Note that this is different from the -Xours option to the recursive merge strategy.

#### git diff modified files
```
  git diff path/to/files.ext

  same as

  git diff HEAD ./path/to/file.ext
```
**i wonder if this still works the same if this file is staged? A: nope it appears to do nothing**

#### compare staged Changes (staged diff)
```
  git diff --cached ./path/to/file
```
**if no staged files it appears to do nothing**
