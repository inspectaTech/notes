# Krita notes

#### [On Windows, the Krita User Interface is too big on my screen](https://docs.krita.org/en/KritaFAQ.html#on-windows-the-krita-user-interface-is-too-big-on-my-screen)   
> google search: krita display too big

  - If you’re using Windows, you can set the display scaling to 150% or 200%. Krita comes with HiDPI enabled by default, so if you do that, the Krita UI might be to
    big for your screen. You can turn it off using the following steps:

  - On the menu, select Settings ‣ Configure Krita…

  - On General page, switch to Window tab.

  - Uncheck Enable Hi-DPI support (or check if you wish to enable it)

  - Press OK, if the settings screen is too big, Alt + O will trigger the OK button too.

  - Restart Krita
